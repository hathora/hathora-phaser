Running TODO:
  ☐ Readme
  ☐ Can you include region and player count in the public lobby list? (can look at https://bullet-mania.vercel.app/ as a reference)
  ☐ Can you add ping count once you have joined the game? Can do what we do in bullet mania for this
  ☐ Small bug where sometimes my controls get "stuck", in that up or right doesn't register anymore. A repro is to right-click somewhere while in the game and then it takes a while for the controls to come back

To discuss:
  ☐ Environment instead of window.location for local check
    We need this to be based on the game importing, not our own lib's build
